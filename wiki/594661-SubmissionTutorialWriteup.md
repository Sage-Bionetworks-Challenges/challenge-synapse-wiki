## **1.  Create a writeup**
   
* Make a Synapse project.  Make a Synapse project.  Ideally, this would be the same project you had used when you uploaded prediction files/Docker image for submission.  Read more about creating [**Synapse projects**](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html#project-and-data-management-on-synapse).
* Add a Wiki page to your project.  View the [**DREAM Challenge Writeup Template**](syn2351771) for an example.  Read more about creating [**Wiki pages**](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html#adding-a-wiki-to-your-project).
* For a writeup to be considered valid, _it must be accessible by the public_ (by default, all new Synapse projects are private). To update your writeup's sharing settings, navigate to **Project Settings** followed by **Project Sharing Settings**, then click on the **Make Public** button at the bottom of the popup screen.  The following settings will be enabled to your Project:

${image?fileName=permissions%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true&altText=Public permissions}

Read more about [**sharing settings**](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/access_controls.html#how-to-share-projects).

## **2.  Submit the writeup**
Follow instructions after clicking the **Submit to the challenge** button and find your project to submit!  Note that a final submission will only be considered if **an associating writeup is submitted before the writeup deadline.**
> ####! Important!
> You **must submit the writeup as the user or team you were on when you submitted  the final submission**; otherwise, the writeup WILL NOT BE LINKED to the final submission, thus disqualifying you and/or the team from becoming consortium-level author(s).
